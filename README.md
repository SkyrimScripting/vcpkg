# Skyrim Scripting `vcpkg` Registry

![Skyrim Scripting](https://github.com/SkyrimScripting/Design/blob/main/Images/SkyrimScripting_Logo.png)

This is a `fork` of the "[Color-Glass Studios Vcpkg Repository](https://gitlab.com/colorglass/vcpkg-colorglass)" with Skyrim Scripting ports added.

> For official Color-Glass Studios ports, please use their official registry!

_This is a fork because I don't know how else to include dependencies on the \*amazing\* [`commonlibsse-ng`](https://github.com/CharmedBaryon/CommonLibSSE-NG) package without sharing the same registry.  
If this is possible, we will no longer fork the Color-Glass Studios registry._

**The following ports are released under the Skyrim Scripting [LICENSE](LICENSE)**:

- *todo*

**All other ports are from the fork of Color-Glass Studios (available as [Apache 2.0](COLOR_GLASS_LICENSE))**

> Thank you to the amazing Charmed Baryon for CommonLibSSE-NG!
